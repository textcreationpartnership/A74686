            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:170330:3"/> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> who thought it as well becoming him to accept of ſmall things from others, as to give great things himſelf.</p>
            <p>Let rotten poſts be guilded, and decayed beauties painted; vertue like a precious Diamond needs no varniſh: Your own graces will ſpring you Rivers of praiſes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the tide of others tongues flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in to brim the banks.</p>
            <p>Reall honour is not built on the glittering foundation of refined clay; the flouriſhing Lawrell of durable excellency, doth not alwayes grow in the ſmooth field of a brave Geneallogy.</p>
            <p>That blood which runs in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues veins, is of a more orient colour then that which ſwims in other channels: The faireſt flowers of humanity, are thoſe that ſpring up
<pb facs="tcp:170330:3"/> in the garden of ſincerity; piety is a more noble thing then parentage; it is better to be new borne, then it is to be high borne.</p>
            <p>I beleeve you count that the ſweeteſt honey which you ſuck out of Chriſts hive, and take more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in your inward goodneſſe, then in your outward greatneſſe.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible what prejudices are taken againſt Epiſtles commendato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; letters are too often like multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying glaſſes, which makes the ſmalleſt mole-hills, appeare like the greateſt Mountains; But yet I dare ſhew your unſpotted faces, without borrowing the ſuſpitious reflection of any falſe glaſſes: You have too cleare a knowledge of God to take any thing into your hands before him, and too deare a love to God, to ſet any thing in your hearts above
<pb facs="tcp:170330:4"/> him; you caſt more propicious aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects upon Religion, then ever to think it a friend unto Rebellion, &amp; lookt upon <hi>Fear God, and honour the King,</hi> as a couple that God had joyned t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>You rejoyced in the firſt dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Morning of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Aegyptian ſlavery and oppreſſion, &amp; deem the ſuperſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of proſperity, is firmlieſt laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the foundation of Monarchy. When others have ſparkled like

It is ſaid of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of ſome great Perſonages, <hi>That there is more oathes heard in a day, then there are prayers made in a yeare;</hi> But I may ſay of yours, there is more prayers made in a day, then there are oathes heard in a yeare: The oyle of grace that is poured on your heads, runs down to the skirts of your garments. O how comely a Viſion is it, to ſee the Tabernacles of great men, to be the Temples of the great God!</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:170330:5"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Honoured Worthies,</hi> Many jewells God hath hung upon your terreſtriall Crown; he hath given you the fatneſſe of the earth, as well as the dew of Heaven, <hi>Eſau</hi>'s Veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as well as <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Bleſſing; the nether ſprings of common bounty, as well as the upper ſprings of ſpeciall mercy: There are four ſhowers that have watred your Garden.</p>

            </list>
            <p>As there is nothing wanting to you, ſo let there be nothing wanting in you; you cannot complain of God for want of mercy, let not God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of you for want of Duty; as he hath opened his hands to bleſſe you, ſo do you open your mouths to bleſſe him: In the higheſt flood and
<pb facs="tcp:170330:5"/> ſpring-tides of outward mercies, its hard to keep our hearts within the channell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſpected Sirs,</hi> You have a large roome in the boſomes of many that are godly; but alas! the beſt mens confidences on earth, are inſufficient evidences for heaven: A houſe well compacted is able to bear out a ſtorme, but a diſ-joynted building every puſh will throw it down. The beſt Patrimony is that above us, &amp; the beſt Teſtimony is that within us; give me ſuch hopes as will not only goe with me to my bed of reſt, but will lye with me in my bed of duſt; as will not only bear me up in the Calme of Life, but will ſhoare me up in the Tempeſt of Death.</p>
            <p>Sirs, You are like Beacons upon a hill which are viſible unto all: A ſmall ſtar may be darkned, and yet
<pb facs="tcp:170330:6"/> paſſe unobſerved, but the eclipſing of the ſuns ſplendor, is a part of the worlds wonder: a crack in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pebble, is not ſo bad as a flaw in the ſmalleſt jewell: O how amiably ſhould you live with men, who look to live eternally with God! The higheſt preheminence, calls for the exacteſt obedience; he is unworthy to be the chiefeſt in a family, that is unwilling to be the choyceſt of a family; yea, he puts a ſword into the hand of Vice, that ſnatches the ſcepter out of the hand of grace: None can challenge an intereſt in the love of God, but ſuch as are indued with the life of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Deare Sirs,</hi> I know you have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to deſire the truth, as well as apprehenſions to diſcerne the truth; and read Books as Bees to fill your Combes, and not as Butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flies
<pb facs="tcp:170330:6"/> to paint your wings; and therefore I have preſented you with a Piece that is not notionall, but practicall.</p>
            <p>A great ſhooe fits not a ſmall foot, nor a large Saile a little Boat; the ſubject is fitter for a Chriſtian to live upon, then for a Critick to look upon: They are as cruell Parents that murder the iſſue of their brains, as thoſe that murder the iſſue of their loynes.</p>
            <p>I hope the dreggs doth not lye ſo thick in it, but you may draw out ſome cleer liquor from it; though the Author be contemptible, yet the matter is conſiderable: God lookes not for what he gives not: (As well as I am able) I have from this Scripture drawn you a Beleevers Picture; and according to this Glaſs doubt not but your ſelves will dreſs. If theſe bellowes keep the veſtall
<pb facs="tcp:170330:7"/> fire alwayes burning upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and your graces have their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, I ſhall have my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. I have here laid the Rods of correction on the backs of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and given the words of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to the hearts of believers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Worthy Sirs,</hi> Compare what is ſpoken in the books of men, with what is written in the Book of God; that the <hi>Briſtoll</hi> ſtone may not paſſe for the ſparkling Diamond, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Braſſe and Copper goe as currant as Gold and Silver. I would lay no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther burdens upon your backs, then I would carry upon my own ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; nor would I have you make any brick, but with Gods ſtraw.</p>
            <p>Mans fault cannot prejudice Gods right; though we have loſt our abillity of obeying, yet he hath not loſt his Authority in commanding:
<pb facs="tcp:170330:7"/> By how much the greater you are then others, by ſo much the better you ſhould be then others: where Divine Providence advances to honourable dignity, there Divine precepts ingages to proportionable duty; on earth it's your buſineſſe to ſerve God, in Heaven it will be your bleſſedneſs to ſee God.</p>
            <p>Many by feeding upon one diſh grow to maturity, when they that ſit down to a multitude are ſurfited with variety: When others grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to look upon rich mens eſtates, doe you tremble to think upon rich mens accounts; and as the earth will doe you no good when you dye, ſo let it do you no hurt whilſt you live.</p>
            <p>They that are in the right way to Paradiſe, ſhould greeve at every thing that hinders their progreſſe:
<pb facs="tcp:170330:8"/> There are many are the Pictures of piety, but I wiſh you may be the patterns of piety. Alas! what's the reflection in the glaſs to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion in the face? or the form of godlineſſe upon us, to the power of godlineſſe within us? ſuch <hi>Jonah's</hi> in the lading of our Veſſells, doth but fill the Seas with ſtormes and tempeſts.</p>
            <p>You Worthies have almoſt ſtretcht your lives to <hi>Davids</hi> ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard; and who knowes how ſoon ſuch may meet with the death of the body that are incompaſſed with the body of death: Whilſt you are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending to the bottom of the hill of nature, I wiſh you may be aſcending to the top of the hill of grace; that the nearer your bodies draw to the pit of corruption, the nearer your ſouls may draw to the place of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
<pb facs="tcp:170330:8"/> that your declining Sun may not ſet under a cloud, that hath ſo long ſhined in a clear sky.</p>
            <p>

            <p>My hearts deſire and prayer to God for both you and yours, is, that you may be as glorious in Heaven, as you have been proſperous on earth; that you may be ſuch jewels of grace, as may be lockt up in the Cabinet of glory; that ſuch ſilver Cups may be found in the mouths of all your ſacks, that the word which hath brought ſalvation to your ſouls, may bring your ſouls unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; that as your children ſit like Olive plants about your Table, ſo you and your children may ſit
<pb facs="tcp:170330:9"/> like Olive plants about his Table; that your little family below, may make up that great family above; that when others as chaffe are thrown into the fire, you as wheat may be gathered into the Garner: That you may live long on earth profitably, and for ever in Heaven joyfully, is the Prayer of</p>

            <p>The Manna of ſpiritual influences, doth uſually fall in the Dew of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Ordinances; To ſet them up was a work of mercy in God to us, and to keep them up is a work of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in us to God; Whileſt we ſuck at theſe Breaſts, they will ſtream warm Milk into our mouths.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dear Chriſtian,</hi> In this Subject I have given thee a breviary of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The works injoyned in it are weighty and ponderous, and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges annexed to it are mighty and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; Chriſtianity is here cloathed in its white Linnen of purity. Wouldſt thou obtaine that happineſſe which the promiſe confirms, thou muſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſe that holineſs which the precept
<pb facs="tcp:170330:10"/> injoynes; The beſt way to greaten your felicity, is to heighten your acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. Grace as it makes our comforts ſweeter, ſo it makes our Crowns grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; And as it begins in the love of God to us, ſo it ends in our love to God; Thoſe children that are found moving in the Orbes of obedience, ſhall have the beautieſt Sunſhine of their Fathers countenance.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, Be ſure to lay your ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtruction upon an unmoveable foundation; and propagate ſuch a buſineſſe, as hath an immediat tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to bleſſedneſſe. It's an unparalel'd mercy to be kept free from corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a time of infection: It's better to be innocent, then it is to be peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; To prevent the malady, then to invent the remedy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> As you have not a Leaſe of your lives, ſo you have not a Brace of your lives; That that which is corrupted in the former, may be corrected in the latter: Had we not need to take heed how we ſhoot, that have but a ſingle Arrow to direct to the mark: No time is ours but what
<pb facs="tcp:170330:11"/> is preſent, and that's as ſoon paſt as preſent: We had need improve that with the greateſt diligence, that glides away with the ſpeedieſt nimbleneſſe. Shall our reſts ſteal away one half of our time, and our luſts the other.</p>
            <p>O <hi>Sirs,</hi> The more you have of good in you, the more you ſhall have of God with you; yea ſpiritual actions they will make you look freſh and orient in the eyes of ſpiritual Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that judge of the trees of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, by the fruits of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The enjoyment of this world is neither an argument of Divine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, nor an evidence of Divine favour; Therefore do not judge your ſelves by your wealth, but by your works, not by the Bags of Gold you have in your hands, but by the Seeds of Grace you have in your hearts: The ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious man ſhall leave all his greatneſſe behind him, when the religious man ſhall carry all his goodneſſe with him. Let Chriſtianity be your ſhop to trade in, and Eternity ſhall be your bed to reſt in; Every grace that is here exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, ſhall there be glorified; The
<pb facs="tcp:170330:11"/> Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall not only ſee the travels of his ſoul, but you ſhall ſee the travels of yours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> Either let your works be according to your profeſſion, or elſe let your profeſſion be according to your works; Never put on the fair ſuit of profeſſion, to do the fowl work of corruption. God will cut down thoſe degenerate Vines that bear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſowr Grapes. The luſts of the fleſh are pleaſurable, where the works of the fleſh are viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sirs,</hi> The Goſpel doth not only require that you ſhould be diligent Chriſtians, but that you ſhould be excellent Chriſtians. By the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of your actions, you may prove the ſincerity of your perſons; The Race is ſhort in which you run, but the Prize is great for which you run. Let not us ſow ſuch bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Lands in which we looſe our time and pains.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:170330:12"/>
            <p>I wiſh that this gail of Divinity may ſpeed your Veſſel to the Haven of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity; And when God gives in more of himſelf to me, I ſhall give out more of him to you; in the mean time it ſhall be my higheſt ambition, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall to others converſion. Who am and ever deſire to be a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of him that is a Saviour to us;</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:170330:16"/> other by the Son of God who was the greateſt: The former to a Prophet of the Lord, the latter by the Lord of the Prophets. As his works were miraculous, ſo his words are myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: But whats light in the book with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out light in the heart: Therefore as he opens the Scripture to our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, ſo he opens our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to the Scripture. The Scribes and Phariſees though they knew the letter of the Law, yet they were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the ſpirit of it: as the waves of the ſea are diſcoverable when the wealth of the ſea is inviſible. They ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver crackt the ſhell, to taſte the kernel; nor unlockt the cabinet to find out the jewel. They made a difference of the Tables, as if one ſide had been of Gods writing, and the other of the Devils ſcribbling. They could not charge the Law with imperfections, but Chriſt charges them with miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpretations. They were better acquainted with the cuſtoms of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then with the Canons of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. How ſhall the blind ſee when the Seers are blind! yet their eyes

Its like the Sun, from the luſtre of whoſe rayes the moſt ſecret cloſets are not hid: Not only he that lyes with a woman, but he that luſts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a woman, is an Adulterer: He whoſe heart is full of hating, though his hand be free from ſtriking, is a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer. Thus a law may be tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, when it is obſerved; as lightning melts the ſword without hurting of the ſcabbard. The luſts of men may be predominate, when the lives of men are not inordinate; as gueſts may be in the houſe when they look not out at the door. The precepts of mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity they order our converſations, but the precepts of Divinity they order our cogitations. The only way to have chryſtal ſtreams, is to caſt ſalt into the ſpring. He that begins Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion where it ſhould end, will end Religion where it ſhould be begun. <hi>I have ſeen an end of all perfection, but thy commandments are exceeding large,</hi> Pſal. 119. 96.

            </p>
            <p>This celeſtial orbe is large enough for every ſtar to ſhine in. You cannot rationally imagine that I ſhould ſluce out a bitter ſtream from ſo ſweet a ſpring. Whoſoever ſhall collect any pearls out of ſuch a heap, will leave as good behinde him as any he carries
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170330:18"/> with him. The Diſciples of Chriſt, as they are more then others, ſo they ſhould do more then others. A Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then may move beyond a Sodomite, but a Chriſtian muſt move beyond an Hypocrite. Though the naturally dead can do nothing, yet the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally dead may do ſomething: Though they can do nothing as to the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the grace of life, yet they may do ſomething as to the uſing of the means of life. <hi>Cicero</hi> complains of <hi>Homer</hi> that he taught the gods to live like men; but grace teaches men to live like gods. Great perſons they are like bells, which whilſt they are riſing ſtrike apace, but when they are up, are ſet, and ſtrike no more; or like flowers, which by change of ſoil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into weeds. Thus the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt mountains are the barreneſt grounds. Its ſad that we ſhould live ſo long in the world, and do ſo little good; or that we ſhould live ſo little in the world, and do ſo much evil. All creatures have their ſeveral eſſences; according to the creatures eſſence, is the creatures actings. Trees are in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170330:19"/> their bearing, as they are in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Other creatures are not more below a ſinner, then a Saint is above a ſinner. Man is the excellency of the creature, the Saint is the excellency of the man; Grace is the excellency of the Saint, Glory is the excellency of Grace. Believers are among others as <hi>Saul</hi> among the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> higher by the head and ſhoulders. They are but baſe-born to them that are twice born. What is the loweſt ſhrubs in the bottom of the valleys, to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt cedars on the tops of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain? Stars that are placed in the higheſt orbes, give the cleareſt lights. Trees planted by the rivers of water yield the choyceſt fruits. They who look for a heaven made ready, ſhould live as though they were in heaven al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. Grace doth not only make a man more a man, but it makes him more then a man. The primitive Chriſtians were the beſt of men, though they were but men at the beſt: None were more lowly in their diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, and none more lovely in their converſations; <hi>Noah was a juſt man,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170330:19"/> and perfect in his generation,</hi> Gen. 6. 9. He was not a ſinner amongſt thoſe that were Saints, but he was a Saint amongſt thoſe that were ſinners: Who would ever have looked for ſo fair a bird in ſo foul a neſt? In a field of wheat, there may ſpring up tares. A Saint is not free from ſin, thats his burthen; a Saint is not free to ſin, thats his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Sin is in his ſoul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thats his lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; his ſoul is not in ſin, thats his conſolation; <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Satan, Haſt thou conſidered my ſervant Job,</hi> Job 1. 8. Why, what was there in <hi>Job</hi> that was ſo conſiderable? <hi>there is none like him in all the earth.</hi> Though there was none ſo bad as <hi>Job</hi> in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, yet there was none ſo good as <hi>Job</hi> on earth. He was a man ſo like unto God, that there was never ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man like unto him. Beleivers in the world, they are the Non-ſuch's of the world. It was the ſaying of a gracious ſoul, hearing of the far go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Hypocrites, <hi>Let Hypocrites go as far as they can, in that which is good I will follow them, and where they can go no further I will go beyond them.</hi> A
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170330:20"/> Chriſtian is not only to do more then all other men will do, but he is to do more then all other men can do. Whatſoever is not above the top of Nature, is below the bottom of grace. Some there are that believe and work not; others there are that work and believe not; but a Saint muſt do both. He muſt ſo obey the Law as if there were no Goſpel to be beleived; and ſo believe the Goſpel as if there were no Law to be obeyed. Its by faith that our works are juſtified; but its by works that our faith is teſtified. A Chriſtians work doth not lie in belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or in doing, but in beleiving and in doing.</p>
            <p>There are Four ſorts of things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Some things that are neither good nor pleaſant, as envy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction. The eclipſing of anothers ſun will never make our own to ſhine with brighter beams. O pare off thoſe envious nails that are ever ſcratching thoſe faces that are fairer then your own. Why do you wound your ſelves with thoſe plaiſters that are laid upon your brethrens ſores? Or weep at every
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170330:20"/> ſhowre of rain that falls beſides your own corn? Who would grudge an Ox its fat paſture, which doth but fit it for the ſlaughter? Or the Malefactors progreſs through the meadows which conducts him to the gallows? Thou haſt never the leſs, for others having of the more; and others have never the more, for thy having of the leſs. <hi>Leahs</hi> fruitfulneſs, was not the ſpring of <hi>Rachels</hi> barrenneſs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Some things are pleaſant but not good, as ſin and tranſgreſſion. This Bee carries honey in its mouth, but a ſting in its tail. When <hi>Jael</hi> brings forth her milk and her butter, then beware of the nail and the ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Death is in the pot whilſt you are taſting of the broth. The fiſh by leaping at the bait is catcht upon the hook. If the cup be ſinful we muſt not taſte it; if the cup be lawful we muſt not carouze it: Reaſon forbids either the taſting of known poyſon, or the being drunk with pleaſant wine. Sin, it is like a river that begins in a quiet ſpring, but ends in a tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſea.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:170330:21"/>
            <p>Thirdly, Some things are good but not pleaſant, as ſorrow and affliction. Sin that's pleaſant, but unprofitable; ſorrow that profitable but unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant. God by affliction ſeparates the ſin that he hates ſo deadly, from the ſoul that he loves ſo dearly. They are not to take our ſpirits out of our fleſh, but to take our fleſh out of our ſpirits. They are not to pull down the tabernacle of Nature without us, but to rear up the temple of Grace within us. Waters are pureſt when they are in their motion, and Saints are holieſt when they are in affliction. A foul feskue may point us to a fair leſſon. Some children never learn their books but when the rod is on their backs. By the greateſt affliction God doth give the ſweeteſt inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Though you may reſiſt the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are laid before you in the word, yet you cannot reſiſt the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are laid upon you by the rod. The pureſt gold is the moſt ductible: thats a good blade that bends well without retaining its crooked figure.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:170330:21"/>
            <p>Fourthly, Some things that are both good and pleaſant, and they are gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious operations. A Beleivers bed of graces is more fragrant then a bed of ſpices. He that gives his Image to us, he loves his Image in us. <hi>Finally my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, whatſoever things are true, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things are honeſt, whatſoever things are juſt, whatſoever things are lovely, whatſoever things are of good report, if there be any vertue, if there be any praiſe, think on theſe things,</hi> Phil. 4. 8. <hi>That ye may approve things that are excellent,</hi> Phil. 1. 10. But becauſe you cannot ſee ſo well by a candle incloſed in a lanthorn, as by a taper burning in the candleſtick; I ſhall crack the ſhell that you may taſt the kernel.</p>
            <p>There are two channels that I ſhall cut out for theſe Chryſtal ſtreams to run in.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſhall ſpeak to the Explication of what is Doctrinal.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To the Application of what is Practical.</p>
            <p>The former is like the cutting out of the ſuit; the latter is like the putting it upon the back.</p>
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:170330:22"/>
            <p>Firſt. I ſhall ſpeak to the Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what is Doctrinal. And that I may not ſluce in a ſea of water into a little river, I ſhall make a double banck.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Why it is that the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Chriſt muſt do more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What it is that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples of Chriſt muſt do more then others.</p>
            <p>I begin with the firſt, why it is that the Diſciples of Chriſt muſt do more then others: Now that theſe nails may ſtick the faſter, I ſhall drive them home with an eight fold hammer.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe more is done for Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers then is done for others; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more muſt be done by Beleivers then is done by others. God gives favours not for their ſakes that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, but for his ſake that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows them. Now where there is a ſuperaddition to our priviledges, there muſt be a ſuperaddition to our practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. You do not look for ſo much ſplendor from the burnings of a candle as from the beamings of the Sun. Nor for ſo much moiſture from the drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170330:22"/> of a bucket, as from the diſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of a cloud. The Philoſophers rule is true, <hi>Quicquid recipitur, reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitur ad modum recipientis.</hi> The heat which melts the wax, hardens the clay. The juyce that goes into the Roſe makes it ſweet, but that which goes into the Nettle makes it ſtink. The mercies of God if they be not load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones to draw us to ſalvation, they will be milſtones to drown us in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. <hi>To whom much is given, of</hi>

               <hi>them much ſhall be required:</hi> God doth not exact much where little is beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; nor except little where much is received. A drop of praiſes is not commenſurate to a ſea of favours. <hi>Hear ye the word of the Lord, O children of Iſrael, you only have I known of all the families of the earth,</hi> Amos 3. 2. They were more known to God then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, therefore they muſt more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge God then others. They can never ſpeak good enough of God who have taſted the goodneſs of God. Its but reaſon that they ſhould bleſs moſt, who are the moſt bleſſed. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath made other Creatures, but
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170330:23"/> Grace hath made you Chriſtians. In Creation God hath given us to our ſelves, but in Redemption he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven himſelf to us. Its a greater favor to be converted, then it is to be created; yea better have no being, then not to have a new being. Now differencing mercy calls for differencing duty. They who hold the largeſt farms, they ſhould pay the greateſt rents. Where he ſows the preciouſeſt ſeeds, there he looks for the fruitfuleſt harveſt. When we were full of blood, then he was full of bowels. When thou wert ſetting ſail to the Devil, God blew with a contrary wind and altered thy courſe. <hi>Now will I ſing to my beloved, a ſong of my beloved touching his vineyard; My wel-beloved had a vineyard in a very fruitful hill, and he fenced it, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out the ſtones thereof, and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it with the choyceſt vine, and built a tower in the midſt of it, and alſo made a wine preſs therein,</hi> Iſa. 5. 1, 2. Here is an Inventory of the goodneſs of God to his vineyard; now what follows? <hi>He looked that it ſhould bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wilde grapes.</hi> He
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170330:23"/> looked that they ſhould be better to him then others, becauſe he had been better to them then he had been to others. The flowers of Paradiſe are ſeated in a better ſoil then the weeds of the wilderneſs. When others are the Devils throughfare, theſe are Gods encloſure. God hath kiſſed you that are believers over many ſhoulders; You are like Dyals in the ſun, on which the beams of the ſun of Righteouſneſs do ſhine. <hi>How is it that thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf to us and not to the world,</hi> who mightſt have ſhewn thy ſelf to the world and not to us! <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 22. He hath exalted you above others, who are of the ſame mould with others. Hath God ſhewn himſelf to you and not to the world, and will not you ſhew your ſelves for God, and not for the world? It lies as a great blemiſh upon <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that his returning was not anſwerable to his receiving. If God do great things for beleivers, he will not accept of ſmall things from believers.</p>
            <p>2. Chriſtians they ſhould do more
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170330:24"/> then others, becauſe they ſtand in a nearer relation to God then others. The nearer the relation, the greater the obligation. In this reſpect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers on earth have a greater honor then the Angels in heaven: Chriſt is related to them as a Lord to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; but he is united to theſe as a head to the members. There is no glaſed eyes that is ſet in our Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers head; there is no wooden legs that are united to his body; there is no barren branches that grows upon the Tree of Life. The Lord Jeſus is as far from being the head of a body thats ulcerous, as he is from being the head of a body thats monſtrous. <hi>The everlaſting Father, Iſa.</hi> 9. 6. Others they are made of God, but theſe are born of God. <hi>A ſon honoreth his father, and a ſervant his Maſter; If then I be a father, where is my honor? if a maſter, where is my fear? Mal.</hi> 1. 6. As a Father, ſo he will be reverenced for his goodneſs; as a Maſter, he will be feared for his greatneſs. <hi>Give unto Caeſar the things that are Caeſars, and unto God the things that are Gods.</hi> If
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170330:24"/> honor be not due to him, let it not be beſtowed; if it be due to him, let it not be denied. We are all born to ſerve God, and better we had never been born, then that we ſhould not ſerve him. As <hi>A. Fulvius</hi> ſaid to his Son, when he found him in the conſpiracy of <hi>Cataline, Non ego te Catilinae, genui ſed patriae.</hi> This is the ſpeech of God to every man, I gave thee not a body and a ſoul to ſerve ſin withal, but to ſerve me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. Do but ſee the great out-cry that God makes againſt his own ſons, <hi>Iſa. 1. 2, 3. Hear O heavens, and be aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed O earth, for I have nouriſhed and brought up children and they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt me.</hi> Where the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is neareſt, there the provocation is greateſt. Its a more pleaſing ſpectacle to ſee Rebels becoming children, then its to ſee children becoming rebels.

               </note> fathers perſon. God will not ſuffer any man to wear the livery of Chriſt upon him, who wants the likeneſs of Chriſt within him. When his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions would have <hi>Alexander</hi> (that was ſwift on foot) to run in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympick games; I would, ſaith he, ſo there were but Kings and Princes to run with me. Give me ſuch a Saint as will do nothing upon earth that is unſuitable to his birth from heaven. What, ſhall he walk in darkneſs, whoſe father is light? Shall that tongue be found lying ſo conſtantly to men, that was found praying ſo earneſtly to God? or thoſe eyes be found ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170330:25"/> on ſinful objects, that were found reading of ſacred Oracles?</p>
            <p>The remembrance of our dignity ſhould engage us to the performance of our duty. <hi>It is not for Kings, O Lemuel, it is not for Kings to drink wine, nor for Princes ſtrong drink, Prov.</hi> 31. 4. Such a ſin is bad in a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but worſe in a Soveraign. As a ſpot in ſcarlet is worſe then a ſtain in ruſſet. Thats the ſecond.</p>
            <p>3. Chriſtians ſhould do more then others, becauſe they profeſs more then others. As plants are known by their fruits, ſo Saints are known by their works. Shall ſuch as have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Chriſts preſs-money, fight un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Satans colours? Though there be many Profeſſors that are no Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, yet there are no Beleevers but are Profeſſors. <hi>They profeſs that they know God, but in works they deny him, being abominable and diſobedient, and to every good work reprobate, Tit.</hi> 1. 16. A man is not what he ſays, but he is what he does. To ſay what we do, and not to do what we ſay, is to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170330:26"/> be like trees that are full of leaves, but empty of fruits: Or like a barn wherein there is much chaff but little corn. Its better never to ſhine, then not to be gold. What is it to put off your old manners, and to keep on the old man? A ſnake may change her coat, and yet keep her ſting. The Goſpel profeſſed that lifts a man unto heaven; but its the Goſpel practiſed that leads a man into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. To be a Profeſſor of piety, and a Practiſer of iniquity, its ſo far from advancing your commendation, that its an encreaſing of your condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the word that I ſay!</hi> Either obey my commands more, or elſe call me Lord no more. Either take me into your lives, or caſt me out of your lips. Our Lord Jeſus diſdains to have his name ſeen on, as Princes ſcorn to have their Effigies ſtampt on baſe mettals. <hi>Let every one that names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.</hi> If godlineſs be evil, why is it ſo much profeſſed? if good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs be good, why is it ſo litle practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed?
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170330:26"/> 
               <hi>Who hath ſaved us and called us with an holy calling,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 10. A holy calling, ſhould be attended with a holy carriage. Its a greater glory to us that we ſerve God, then it is to God that we ſerve him. It is not he thats made happy by us, but its we that are made happy by him. He needs not ſuch ſervants as we are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, but we need ſuch a Maſter as he is in heaven, A man may finde many that talks of grace, but he ſhall find but a few that taſtes of grace. Every one doth no live like a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an that looks like a Chriſtian. <hi>Thou that makeſt thy boaſt of the Law, through breaking the Law diſhonoreſt thou God!</hi> Rom. 2. 23. Its monſtrous to ſee that Chriſtians tongues ſhould be larger then their hands. That they ſhould carry a lanthorn before others, and yet tread in the dark themſelves. A vicious patern more infects, then a vertuous doctrine inſtructs. he that gives good precepts, and then ſets bad paterns, is like a man that firſt blows the fire to kindle it, and after caſts water to quench it again. Theſe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170330:27"/> Phyſitians whileſt they give cordials to others, they faint themſelves. I may ſay of ſuch Profeſſors, as he ſaid of a vicious Preacher, <hi>That when in the Pulpit, it was pity he ſhould ever come out, he was ſo good in his inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but when out of the pulpit, that it was pity he ſhould ever come in again, he was ſo bad in his converſation.</hi> We muſt not be offended at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Religion, becauſe all are not religious that make a profeſſion. The ſheep doth not deſpiſe his fleece, becauſe the Woolf hath worn it. Who blames a chryſtial river becauſe ſome melancholly men have drowned themſelves in its ſtreams. The beſt Drugs have their adulterate? What though you have been cheated with falſe colours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet diſeſtimate not them that are dyed in grain: He is a bad husband, that having a ſpot in his coat will cut off the cloath, when he ſhould waſh out the dirt. But when you make a good profeſſion, be ſure to make your profeſſion good.</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:170330:27"/>
            <p>4. The Diſciples of Chriſt are to do more then others, becauſe every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever is to be conformed to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. Jeſus Chriſt, as he is the principle of excellency, to which all muſt come, ſo he is the patern of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency to which all muſt conform. As he is the root on which a Saint grows, ſo he is the rule by which a Saint ſquares. God hath made one Son like unto all, that he might make all his ſons like unto one. He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to teach us how to live, and he died to teach us how to die. Yea, as he lived and died for our good, ſo he lived and died in our ſtead. Its a rule, <hi>Primum unoquoque genere eſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſura reliquorum: That which is the firſt in any kind,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly, Matth.</hi> 11. 29. Never was Nature better graced, and never was Grace better natured. Well may the Stars be obſcured, when the Sun was eclipſed. <hi>For I have given you an example, that you ſhould do as I have done to you, Joh.</hi> 13. 5. If the life of Chriſt be not your patern, the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170330:28"/> death of Chriſt will not be your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. The Lord Jeſus though he was a man of ſorrows, yet he was not a man of ſins. Though we cannot e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualize his holineſs, yet we ſhould imitate his holineſs: As it is the ſame light which ſhines from the body of the ſun in its meridian, and which breaks forth in the dawnings of the morning. There's the ſame water in the ſtreams that bubbles up at the ſpring-head. <hi>Summa religionis eſt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

He that was a way to others, never went out of the way himſelf. A holy life is a chryſtal glaſs wherein Jeſus Chriſt beholds his own face. In our Sacramental participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we ſhew forth the death of Chriſt, but in our evangelical conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations we ſhew forth the life of Chriſt.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170330:28"/> An excellent Chriſt calls for excellent Chriſtians: And why ſhould we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ay his yoke is heavy, when he ſays his yoke is eaſie? <hi>He went about doing good,</hi> Acts 10. 38. As he was never ill imployed, ſo he was never unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. Jeſus Chriſt ſubmits his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be judged by his actions. <hi>If I do not the works—beleeve me not.</hi> If I act not like a Saviour, do not take me for a Saviour. Thus ſhould it be with a Saint; Never take me for a Chriſtian, if I act not like a Chriſtian. If men finde no more among Saints then they find among men, they will ſay, Here is a man and a man, and not a man and a Chriſtian. Man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally is an aſpiring piece, and loves to be neareſt to thoſe that are higheſt. Now a Chriſt that did more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, calls on Chriſtians to do more then others. Methinks you ſhould take as much delight in thoſe precepts that enjoyn holineſs, as in thoſe promiſes that aſſures happineſs; and be as willing to be ruled by Chriſt, as you are willing to be ſaved by Chriſt. <hi>To the Saints that are in the earth, and to the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170330:29"/> in whom is all my delight, Pſa.</hi> 16. 3. Was it ſo in his time, and ſhall i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out-ſhines the Old, as much as the ſplendor of the ſun doth the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſtars. If you live under more glorious diſpenſations, you ſhould have more gracious converſations. <hi>As he is, ſo are we in this world, 1 Joh.</hi> 4. 17. As he was, ſo ſhould we be on earth; and as he is, ſo ſhall we be in heaven. If there be no congruity between Chriſt and you in holineſs, there will be no ſociety between Chriſt and you in happineſs. Thats the fourth.</p>
            <p>5. The Diſciples of Chriſt muſt do more then others, becauſe they are more lookt upon then others. If once a man be a Profeſſor, the eyes of the whole world are placed upon him. Becauſe our profeſſion in the world is a ſeparation from the world, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers ſhould condemn thoſe by their lives, who condemn them with their lips. <hi>Teach me thy way, O Lord, and lead me in a plain path becauſe of mine

Heb. <hi>Becauſe of my obſervers,</hi> or <hi>propter inſidiatores meos, becauſe of thoſe that lye in wait for me.</hi> If you walk in the unpaved road of licentious looſneſs, the world will not go backwards, like <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Japhet</hi> to cover your nakedneſs, but they will march forward, like curſed <hi>Cham</hi> to uncover your nakedneſs. They make uſe of your weakneſs, as a ſhield to defend their own wickedneſs. Men are mercileſs in their cenſures, though God hath more equitable ſcales, and wil give grains of allowance to his own gold.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170330:31"/> Every being nath its proper acting; and where we do not finde the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we may deny the being. You would be thought to be more then Publicans and Sinners; what, and yet act no more then Publicans and Sinners? <hi>Ye ſhall know them by their fruits,</hi> Mat. 7. 20. By the leaves the tree is ſeen, but by the fruit the tree is known. The hand of the Dyal is without in going, as the wheels of the clock are within in moving. Where the heart is of a good conſtitution, the life will be of a fair complexion. When the Conduit is walled in, how ſhall we judge of the Spring, but by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that runs out of the pipes? A Sinner may ſhew the good he wants, but a Saint cannot hide the good he hath. When <hi>Saul</hi> was made a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, he had another ſpirit poured out upon him, a ſpirit of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a place of Government; When a ſinner is made a Saint, he hath another ſpirit poured out upon him: As he is what he was not, ſo he does what he did not. Its reported of a Harlot, when ſhe ſaw one with whom
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170330:31"/> ſhe had formerly committed folly, ſhe renewed her inticements, to whom he anſwered, <hi>Ego non ſum ego,</hi> though ſhe was the ſame woman ſhe was, yet he was not the ſame man he was. For him that is more then a man, to do no more then a man, where is the Chriſtian? <hi>Are ye not carnal, and walk as men?</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 3. If men act like beaſts, God will call them beaſts; and if Chriſtians act like men, he will ſtile them men. There is no paſſing for currant coyn on earth, without having of the ſtamp of heaven. That's the ſixth.</p>
            <p>7. The Diſciples of Chriſt are to do more then others, becauſe they are to be judges of others. If you conſult ſacred Records, you ſhall find that both God, and Chriſt, and the Saints are ſaid to judge the world; the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is Gods, the execution is Chriſts, the approbation is the Saints. When the Apoſtle would ſtop the ſinful ſuits among the <hi>Corinthian</hi> brethren, that did not want men of Eminency to put a period unto controverſie, <hi>Do
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170330:32"/> ye not know that the Saints ſhall judge the world? and if the world ſhall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the ſmalleſt matters?</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 2. If you ſhall judge in cauſes between God and man, how much more in cauſes between man and man? if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout matters that are eternal, then about matters that are external? fellons may be jovial in the priſon, but they tremble at the Bar. When wicked men come like miſerable cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives out of their holes, how ſhall the Saints riſe out of their graves like morning ſuns? <hi>Enoch the ſeventh from Adam propheſied ſaying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thouſands of his Saints, to execute judgement upon all,</hi> Jude 14, 15. This ſhall no more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from Chriſts Office then the Seſſion of the Juſtices doth from the authority of the Judge; they are Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operators, though not Coadjutators in that peculiar act. <hi>When the Son of Man ſhall ſit in the throne of his glory, ye alſo ſhall ſit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve Tribes of Iſrael, Matth.</hi> 19. 28. Now the world judges
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170330:32"/> the Saints, but then the Saints ſhall judge the world; the act of the head is imputed to the members; and the act of the members is acknowledged by the head. Now ſhall there be no difference between him that ſits on the Bench and him that ſtands at the Bar?</p>
            <p>How will you be able to paſs a righteous ſentence upon others for thoſe evils you are guilty of your ſelves? <hi>In maxima fortuna minima licentia, In the greateſt majeſty there is the ſmalleſt liberty.</hi> As he ſaid to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar, Caeſari cum omnia licent, propter hoc minus liceat; Seeing all things are lawful for Caeſar to do, it is therefore the leſs lawful for</hi> Caeſar <hi>to do them. By faith Noah built an Ark by which he condemned the world,</hi> Heb. 11. 7. The Saints judge the world not only by their faith but by their facts. In the innocency of your lives, you ſhould ſhew the world the filthineſs of theirs; <hi>Thou art more righteous then I.</hi> What is the uſual prejudice that the world hath againſt Religion but this, that it makes no man better though it makes
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170330:33"/> ſome men ſtricter. Do not we ſee that they who profeſs againſt pride more then others, are themſelves as as proud as others? Theſe people they often meet together to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but they are never the better for their often meeting together; do but take away their profeſſion, and you take away their Religion. They have nothing of the ſheep but the skin. Do but ſee how the God of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> doth upbraid the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God; <hi>Hath a Nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my people hath changed their glory for that which doth not profit,</hi> Jer. 2. 11. Here is a profeſſing people out-gone by a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that made no profeſſion. The Heathens, if they take up their gods, they will keep up their gods. They were true to their falſe gods, when theſe were falſe to the true God. <hi>Hear O heavens, and be aſtoniſhed O earth,</hi> Iſa. 1. 2. Why, what is the matter? <hi>the ox knoweth his own, and the Aſs his Maſters crib; but my people doth not know, and Iſrael doth not conſider.</hi> God did not call down a Jury of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170330:33"/> to condemn them, but empannels a jury of Oxes and Aſſes to paſs ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon them. O that Oxes and Aſſes ſhould be more religious, then thoſe who do profeſs Religion! In their kind they are more kind; for if the owner feeds them, the owner rides them. That is the ſeventh.</p>
            <p>8. Reaſon why the Diſciples of Chriſt ſhould do more then others, becauſe they expect more then others. <hi>And every man that hath this hope, purifies himſelf as he is pure,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 3.

There is no living a life that is vicious, and then dying a death that is righteous. As Juſtice cruſhes none before they are corrupted, ſo Mercy crowns none before they are converted. <hi>Follow peace with all men, and holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord, Heb.</hi> 12. 14. Holineſs, though it be that which a ſinner ſcorns, yet its that which a Saviour crowns: The ſoul of man that is the

Though the wheat be for the Garner, yet the chaff is for the fire. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture preſents us not only with what God will do for man, but with what man muſt do for God. <hi>So run that ye may obtain.</hi> The neglecting of the race of holineſs, will be the obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the prize of bleſſedneſs. He that made thee without thy aſſiſtance, will not ſave thee without thy obedience. <hi>Every tree that beareth not good fruit is hewen down and caſt into the fire, Mat.</hi> 7. 19. If you be not plants for bearing, you will be ſticks for burning. If you be not for fruits, you are for flames. Men are ſentenced not only for their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, but for their ſlothfulneſs. Men may periſh for being ſervants that are unprofitable, as well as for ſinners that are abominable. There is no making out of your ſalvation, but by working out of your ſalvation. God binds up none in the bundle of life, but ſuch as are the heirs of life. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my beloved brethren, be ye ſtedfaſt

How abundant ſhould they be in the work of the Lord, that know their labor ſhall not be in vain in the Lord? How chearfully ſhould we caſt in the net, when we are ſure to make ſuch an excellent draught? If you do no more then others, you ſhall enjoy no more then others. <hi>If you love them that love you, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward have you? Matth.</hi> 5. 46.

Light without heat, doth little good; and heat without light doth much hurt. Give me thoſe Chriſtians that are burning lamps as well as they are ſhining lights. The Sun is as vigorous in its moving, as it is luminous in its ſhining. I know the light of nature wants force to repel the luſts of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

It may make a man an earthly Courtier, but it will never make a man an heavenly Martyr. Wicked men they ſtumble at ſtraws in the way of ſalvation, that can leap over blocks in the rode of deſtruction.

            <p>Though the braine be the ſpring of ſenſitive motion, yet the heart is the Originall of vitall motion. The heart its <hi>Primum vivens, ultimum moriens,</hi> its the firſt that lives, and the laſt that dyes: <hi>O Jeruſalem waſh thy heart from wickedneſs, how long ſhall vain thoughts lodge within thee?</hi> Jer. 4. 14.

            <p>The Devill knows if there be any good treaſure it is in our hearts, and he would faine have the key of this Cabinet to rob us of our Jewells.

            <p>It is not the bare touching of the ſtrings that is the making of the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick.

            <p>All the inferiour Orbes they follow the motion of the ſuperiour ones. If the heart be inditing of a good mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the tongue will be as the pen of a ready writer.</p>
            <p>It's obſerved of the ſpider, that in the morning, before ſhe ſeeks her prey ſhe mends her broken webb, and in the doing of it, ſhe alwayes begins in the middle: Chriſtians before you purſue the profits and the pleaſures of the world, you ſhould mend the broken webbs of your lives, and in the doing of it you ſhould alwayes begin at the heart. If you would have the Cocks to run wholſome water, you muſt looke well to the ſprings that feeds them. The heart is the preſence Chamber where the King of glory takes up his lodgings. That which is moſt worthy in us, ſhould be given to him that is moſt worthy of it.</p>

            <p>It's ſaid of the <hi>Lacedamonians</hi> that were a poor people, and of the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> that were a rich people; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer offered up leane ſacrifices to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo,</hi> the latter fat ones: Yet in their warres, the <hi>Lacedamonians</hi> were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes conquerours, and the <hi>Athenians</hi> were alwayes conquered; whereupon

            <p>Religion that's a ſacrifice, but the heart that's the Altar upon which it muſt be offered. As the body is at the command of the ſoule that rules it, ſo ſhould the ſoule be at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God that gives it. For a man to ſend his body to the ſervice of God, and leave his ſoul behind him; it's as if a man ſhould ſend his cloath's ſtuff't with ſtraw inſtead of a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall appearance.</p>

            <p>Tell me ſoul, was there nothing within thee that could draw thee to him? and is there any thing without thee that ſhall draw thee from him?

<pb n="410" facs="tcp:170330:210"/> in one word: <hi>For all the law is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in one word</hi> (Gal. 5. 14.)

It's as old as the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and yet as new as the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Faith is the grace that at firſt ſeals the conveyance, and love is the grace that at laſt poſſeſſes the inheritance; Faith that unites Chriſt and ſanctified ſouls together on earth, but love that unites God and glorified ſouls toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Heaven.</p>
            <p>As the ſpleen groweth, the body de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayeth; and as hatred increaſeth, ſo holineſſe abateth. <hi>Die aliquid ut duo ſimus,</hi> was the Motto of a Heathen, and therefore doth not belong to a Chriſtian. It's beſt that diſſention ſhould never be born among brethren, and next that it ſhould dye preſently after it's birth: When any leak ſprings in the ſhip of Chriſtian ſociety, we

The nearer the union is, the more dangerous is the breach; Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that are glewed together may (if ſevered) be ſet together as beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully as ever, but members rent and torne cannot be healed without a ſcar.</p>
            <p>The love in a hypocrites boſome is juſt like the fire in the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> buſh, which was not burning all the while it was blazing; His eſtate and relations hath the top and ſtrength of his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; they admit the world not only into the Suburbs of their ſences, but into the City of their ſouls: But the love of a Saviour in the ſoul of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, is as Oyl put into a Vial with water, in which, though both be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much ſhaken together, the oyl will be uppermoſt; Or if you pleaſe, as one riſing Sun which drowns the light of numberleſs Starres: Should God give his ſubſtance to him, and yet keep himſelf from him, <hi>Abſalom</hi>'s ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion would be his, <hi>What doth all avail me, ſo long as I ſee not the Kings face?</hi> Take a Chriſtian and his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

            <p>The higheſt graces are fit for the hardeſt duties: As God is not ſo much diſpleaſed at our having of ſin, as he is diſpleaſed at our loving of ſin; ſo he is not ſo well pleaſed at our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſervice, as at our loving of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.

Prayer its like <hi>Noahs</hi> Dove, though it goe forth of the Arke, yet it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn againe with an Olive-branch of peace in its mouth.</p>
            <p>In Gods injoyning our ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons there's the ſhewing forth of his greatneſſe, in Gods fulfilling our ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications there's the ſhining forth of his goodneſſe: Prayer, never did man rightly make it, but God did quickly grant it; It's no more a duty for Saints on earth to give over praying, then it is a duty for Saints in Heaven to give over praiſing.</p>
            <p>If you would ſpeed in the injoying of mercy, you muſt ſpeak for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of mercy; If man lets God goe without any begging, God will let man goe without any bleſſing. I am ſadly ſenſible how many there are

            <p>Chriſtians though your relations are excellent, yet your conditions are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent. No Chriſtian hath ſo little of Chriſt but he hath matter for praiſe, and no Chriſtian hath ſo much from Chriſt but he hath matter of prayer; every day we find it a great worke to accompliſh a little work; every new act of obedience, calls for new ſtrength and aſſiſtance: as our receits are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then our deſarts, ſo our wants are larger then our receits. <hi>Ask, and ye ſhall receive, that your joy may be full.</hi>
               <pb n="417" facs="tcp:170330:213"/> Spirituall ſupplication is the channell of ſpirituall conſolation; you muſt be full of prayers, if you would be full of joyes: now none are more fruitfull in divine labour, then thoſe who are moſt joyfull in divine favour.

            <p>Prayer is Gods due as a Creator, though truly performed to him as a

            <p>Chriſtians can never want a praying time, if they do not want a praying frame; in the morning this is a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den key to open the heart for ſerviſe, and in the evening it is an iron lock to ſhut the heart from ſin.</p>
            <p>As the raine comes down from Heaven fruitfully, ſo let prayer go up to Heaven fervently. <hi>Peter was kept in priſon, but prayer was made without ceaſing for him,</hi> (Act. 12. 5.) And prayer fetcht an Angel out of Heaven, to fetch <hi>Peter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>Perceiving of Chriſt ſpeaks a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians knowledge, but it's a receiving of Chriſt that ſpeaks a chriſtians faith: <hi>To as many as received him, to them he gave power to become the Sons of God, even to as many as believed on his name,</hi> Joh. 1. 12.

Lord by this time he ſtinketh;</hi> As if the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians potion came too late, and the Grave would not make any ſurrender though Chriſt commands the releaſe of its priſoner; but their unbeliefe ſtunk more in his noſtrills, then their brothers body did in theirs. <hi>And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not weak in faith, he conſidered not his own body now dead, when he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an hundred years old, neither yet the deadneſſe of</hi> Sarahs <hi>womb,</hi> Rom. 4. 19.</p>
            <p>Skilfull ſwimmers are not afraid to goe above their depth, whereas young learners grope for the ground and are loth to ſtirre from the bank-ſide,</p>

               </note> receive the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt for our juſtification, but it's the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to receive the holineſs of Chriſt
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:170330:218"/> for our ſanctification: <hi>Of his fullneſſe we receive grace for grace,</hi> John 1. 16. But how do we receive it? <hi>Even by Faith.</hi> Faith unites the ſoul to Chriſt, and as by a pipe laid cloſe to the mouth of a fountaine, water is carried to our houſes for the ſupply of the whole family; ſo by faith is derived to the ſoule in abundance, a ſupply for all its exigences: <hi>He that beleeves, out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing waters,</hi> Joh. 7. 38. Hence it is, that when the Saints would advance to a high pitch in other graces, they pray for an increaſe of this grace: <hi>Lord, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our faith,</hi> Luk. 17. 5. What the root ſucks from the earth, it ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perces amongſt the branches.</p>

            <p>As luſts would not let Chriſt live without us, ſo Chriſt will not let luſts live within us: <hi>Holding the Miſtery of faith in a pure conſcience,</hi> Tim. 3. 9.<note place="margin">Fides eſt cardo ſuper quem verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur porta Caeli; ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la per quam hauritur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua vitae; annulus ille nuptialis quo mens Deo deſponſatur &amp;c. <hi>Arrowſin; Tact. ſacr. l. 2. cap. 7.

            <p>Faith comes out of the warrs a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, when fear is foyled and taken priſoner; it's as potent to keep us from falling under temptations, as to keep us from fainting under afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>The body of <hi>Adam</hi> it is a Rack for ſufferings, but the boſome of <hi>Abraham</hi> is an Ark for reſting. A Beleever is like <hi>Joſeph,</hi> though the Archers ſorely grieved him, and ſhot at him, yet his bow abode in ſtrength, and all his
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:170330:219"/> Arrowes were ſafe in the Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, never was the Tallent of faithfullneſs wrapped up in the Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin of idleneſs. He is a rich man that lives upon his wealth, but he is a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man that lives upon his faith.</p>
            <p>The firſt poyſonous breath which was drawn by <hi>Eves</hi> lips, was ſent in thoſe words; <hi>Yea, hath God ſaid ye ſhall not eat?</hi> This was the Traitors gate tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row which all ſin entered into the heart: A Tree is eaſily felled when its root is looſned.</p>
            <p>Unbeleef it doth not only choake the bullets of wrath which are ſent out of the fiery mouth of the Law, but it damps all the motions of grace, which comes from the ſtill voyce of the Goſpell. All the offers of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation which are made to unbeleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſons, they are like ſparks of fire falling into a river of water, that are extinguiſht by it as ſoon as ever they light upon it.</p>
            <pb n="429" facs="tcp:170330:219"/>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Would you do more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, then reſolve more then others.</hi> It is the reſolute Chriſtian, that is the excellent chriſtian: An action that is well reſolved, is an action that is halfe performed: God looks more at our wills then at our works.</p>
            <p>The very firſt fruits of converſion, they grow upon the Tree of holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution: <hi>I will ariſe, and go to my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Luke 15. 15. Arrows weakly ſhot fall ſhort of their marks.</p>
            <p>Many ſtand watching on what dyall the Sun ſhines, and on what earth the cloud drops; they ſtand as ſpectators on the ſhoare; whilſt the Veſſell is toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on the Sea.</p>
            <p>Shame is that which ambicious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture abhors, and danger is that which timorous nature declines. Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is an Icy path, and cowardly ſpirits love to have it well beaten by others, before they will ſet a foot in it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>Firme reſolutions are like Rocks, againſt which the waves may beat and ſtrike, but cannot move and alter. As our prayers manifeſt what we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:170330:220"/> that God ſhould do for us, ſo our purpoſes manifeſt what we our ſelves are deſirous to do for God.</p>
            <p>The holineſs of a Saints life, may be reſembled to a babes birth. In eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry birth there's three things; A Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, a Travelling, and a bringing forth: So there's a conceiving of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe in our underſtandings, by way of illumination; there's a Travelling of holineſſe in our wills, by way of reſolution; and there's a bringing forth of holineſs in our lives by way of operation.</p>
            <p>Till you attain to firme reſolutions, you will never be free from great temptations: Look as it is with the ill humours of the body, they flock and reſort to the crazy part; ſo it is with Sathans aſſaults, they will be ever fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent where the heart is ready to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them, or not reſolved to reſiſt them.</p>
            <p>The Laws Curſe is the preſs-money to force a ſervile ſpirit, but the love of God is the by as of a Volunteer.</p>
            <p>Your purpoſes and reſolutions muſt be like water from a fountaine, that
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:170330:220"/> flowes of it ſelf, and not like water from a pit, that is fetcht forth by arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall Engines.</p>
            <p>Some never take up any reſolutions but when they are under ſharp afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; theſe are like thoſe Goates, that never give any milke till they are ſtung: Like children under the rod, they make fair promiſes; but all theſe bloſſomes falls from the Tree without bearing of any fruits: when they are raiſed from their ſick-bed pains, they fall from their ſick-bed vowes; Theſe are like Ice that thaws in the Sun, but freezes in the ſhade: They hang their luſts on the Croſs for a time that they may be curbed, but take them down again that they may not be crucified; what is this but to put a Lion in chains and then let him looſe again.</p>
            <p>There muſt be a harmony between your reſolutions and your converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: What ſhall we vow againſt our ſins, and then ſin againſt our vowes? This were to take the wages of one Maſter, &amp; to do the work of another; to make our promiſes unto God, and our performances to the Devill.</p>
            <pb n="432" facs="tcp:170330:221"/>
            <p>Sacred vowes bind us to obedience, but ſinfull vowes bind us to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Chriſtians, ſay not that you have noble blood running in your veins, except you can prove your pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digrees by heroick ſpirits: That's the Fifth.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Would you do more then others, then deny your ſelves more then others.</hi> Either we muſt lay ſelf aſide, or elſe God will lay us aſide: What can any true <hi>Iſraelite</hi> ſee in this <hi>Dagan</hi> of the Philiſtins, that the Ark of God ſhould fall before it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Self ſeeking,</hi> ſaith one, <hi>was born in heaven, but forgetting by what way ſhe fell from thence, ſhe could never find the road thither again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his croſs and follow me;</hi> This is the baſis or foundation on which we muſt build the whole fabrick of our profeſſion. Sinfull ſelfe is to be deſtroyed, and naturall ſelf is to be denyed.</p>
            <p>A little will ſerve a man that is ſtrong in grace, much will but ſerve a
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:170330:221"/> man that is weak in grace, but nothing will ſerve a man that is voyd of grace.</p>
            <p>As we muſt lay out all in the Cauſe of God, ſo we muſt lay down all at the call of God.</p>
            <p>But to cloſe up all, The Elder Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites they mourned to ſee how ſhort the glory of the ſecond Temple, was of the glory of the firſt: I fear that we have cauſe to mourn, to ſee how far ſhort our profeſſors come in purity of their fore fathers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold, I come quickly, &amp; my reward is with me, to give every man according as his works ſhall be,</hi> Revel. 22. 12. This very expreſſion may much excite to eminency in Religion: He that doth moſt, ſhall receive moſt; the more glory you bring to God, the more glory you ſhall have from God.</p>
            <p>The clearer the lamp of grace burns on earth, the brighter the Sun of glory ſhall ſhine in Heaven.</p>
            <p>Though your pilgrimage may be full of bitterneſſe, yet your heritage will be full of bleſſedneſſe. Let ſuch
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:170330:222"/> golden ſpurs put you upon your full careers.</p>
            <p>Mans excellency is to be meaſured by the ſtandard of his uſefullneſſe. The Sun and Moon thoſe fountains of light and guids of time, fulfill their courſes in a ſhorter ſeaſon, when the dimmer planets are longer wheeling. O that it might be ſaid of you, as it was ſaid of her, <hi>Prov. 31. 29. Many daughters have done vertuouſly, but thou haſt excelled them all.</hi>
